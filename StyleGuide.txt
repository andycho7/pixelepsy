Style Guide


Indentation

	4 spaces are used for indentation

Declaring Variables

	Declare each variable on a separate line

	Single character variable names are only okay for counters and temporaries, where the purpose of the variable is obvious

	Avoid short or meaningless names (e.g. "a", "rbarr", "nughdeget")

	Variables and functions start with a lower-case letter. Each consecutive word in a variable's name starts with an upper-case letter

Whitespace

	Use blank lines to group statements together where suited

	Always use only one blank line

	Always use a single space after a keyword and before a curly brace

	No space after a cast

	Do not put multiple statements on one line
		By extension, use a new line for the body of a control flow statement

Braces

	Use attached braces: The opening brace goes on the same line as the start of the statement. If the closing brace is followed by another keyword, it goes into the same line as well

	Exception: Function implementations and class declarations always have the left brace on the start of a line:

	Exception 1: Use braces also if the parent statement covers several lines / wraps

Parentheses

	Use parentheses to group expressions

Line breaks

	Keep lines shorter than 100 characters; wrap if necessary
		Comment/apidoc lines should be kept below 80 columns
	
	Commas go at the end of wrapped lines; operators start at the beginning of the new lines. An operator at the end of the line is easy to miss if the editor is too narrow.

Genereal Exception
	
	When strictly following a rule makes your code look bad, feel free to break it.
